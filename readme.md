Let's learn electronics together.

## Overview

Starting with the most basic circuits (and ICs), let's learn electronics via small projects and tutorials that we share here. To start, I'm approaching this with a series of 'hello world' tasks that become increasingly more interesting, see the Goals section below.

## QuickStart

### Phase 1

#### Posts

 * ![hello-world](posts/hello-world/01-multisegment-led)

#### Source

 * src/EightSegmentLED

## Dependencies

### Software

1. TODO

### Tools

#### Complete Lab

This is a more or less complete lab setup (you don't need all of this)

#### Cheap Lab

This is a much cheaper lab setup (you only need some of this)

* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HicV3Z6XLFA

#### Minimalist Lab

I think you could bootstrap without a scope, use an old wall wart for a power supply (or scavenge an old computer power supply), create a voltage divider with some resistors, and you are ready to go.

Things I think you need but you can go cheap on:

* soldering iron
* wire
* solder/flux
* breadboard
* perfboard
* multi-meters (2)
* capacitors
* resistors

#### No Lab

For the hello-world stuff, all you need is an arduino, a breadboard, some wires, a resistor, and an 8 segment LED. There are kits to be had for less than $25 that have all this and more.

### Books

The Art Of Electronics (old version, may cost ~$20-40)

* https://www.thriftbooks.com/w/the-art-of-electronics_paul-horowitz_winfield-hill/248534/#isbn=0521231515&idiq=4482077

Or get the latest, but $120 is pretty steep.

Practical Electronics For Inventors

* https://www.thriftbooks.com/w/practical-electronics-for-inventors_paul-scherz/308734/#isbn=0071452818&idiq=8674669

I buy older books, then when I've read the whole thing (rarely but sometimes happens) I buy the new book.

### Chips

#### Phase 1 : Arduino ATMega328P

I bought a couple of these on ebay for about $10. Get the UNO R3 with socketed IC so you can remove the chip and embed it
on a board later. I also ordered 4 chips with resistor, oscillator, and socket for another $20.

### Phase 2 : ESP32-S2

The dev kit is about $60 with shipping from digikey:

* https://www.digikey.com/products/en?keywords=ESP32-S2-Kaluga-1%20Kit

or we can use the STM Discovery board...

https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/stm32f3discovery.html

I'm not sure which board to use for Phase 2 yet... suggestions?

### Phase 3

The F1C100s has 32MB in the chip, and can be had for $1.50 qty 1, less than $1 in quantity. I bought 10 of these for less than $20 including shipping.
According to the datasheet, this is an amazing piece of tech with loads of audio visual subsystems...

## Goals

Output 'Hello World', or it's equivalent, using increasingly interesting and challenging technologies.

### Phase 1

1. Manually trigger an LED on and off, with a power supply, switch and a resistor.
1. Manually trigger the segments of a 7 segment LED display on and off, again using just power supply, switches, and resistors.
1. Use ATMega328P to programmatically control 7 segment LED display, using no libs, just the GPIO pins, power supply, and resistors. 
1. Solder a multi character LED display.
1. Controll multi character LED display directly via ATMega328P
1. Solder a SPI|I2C|UART backpack(s) for LED display
    Note: the backpack needs a micro-controller or a GPIO expander... options are MCP23017, PCF8574, or ATMega328P. Personally, I think the ATMega328P is the easiest choice as it already supports SPI|I2C|UART.
1. ATMega328P sends 'Hello World' over SPI|I2C|UART to backpack, backpack controls LED display

### Phase 2

Using the STM or ESP, output a graphical 'hello world' to a graphical display of some sort.

### Phase 3

Using the F1C100s, output 'hello world' using a video codec such as H.264,H.263,MPEG1/2/4 to a graphical display of some sort.

### Phase 4

Using the F1C100s, serve the 'hello world' video stream over the internet.


# Notes

I2C

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I%C2%B2C

STM

STM devices can speak many protocols: IÂ²C, IrDA, SPI, UART/USART

This is the backpack that we are basically creating from scratch.
